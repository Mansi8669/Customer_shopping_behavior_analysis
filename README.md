## 4. Project Workflow

### 🔹 Step 1: Data Loading

* Imported dataset using Pandas
* Inspected structure and summary statistics
* Identified data types and missing values

Key functions used:

* `.read_csv()`
* `.info()`
* `.describe()`
* `.isnull().sum()`

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed detailed analysis to understand:

* Distribution of numerical variables
* Category-level performance
* Trends over time
* Correlation between metrics

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Data Cleaning & Transformation

* Handled missing values
* Standardized formats

### 🔹 Step 4: SQL Analysis (MySQL)

The cleaned dataset was imported into MySQL to perform structured queries and extract key insights.

Examples of analysis:

* Revenue by category
* Top-performing entities
* Aggregated KPIs
* Ranking analysis using GROUP BY and ORDER BY

This step demonstrates strong database and analytical query skills.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Power BI Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:

* KPI cards 
* Trend analysis charts
* Category performance visuals
* Top entities ranking
* Interactive filters 

The dashboard enables stakeholders to dynamically explore business performance.

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Business Report & Presentation

**Business Report**

* Executive summary
* Key findings
* Data-driven insights
* Strategic recommendations

**Presentation (Gamma)**

* Clear storytelling structure
* Visual data highlights
